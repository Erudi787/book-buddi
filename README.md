## 🔄 Development Workflow

We follow a **lightweight Gitflow-inspired workflow** for teamwork, accountability, and clean code.

1. **Issues** → Every task/feature/bug should have a GitHub Issue.
2. **Branches** → Branch from `develop`, keep changes focused.
3. **Pull Requests (PRs)** → Open into `develop`. Require at least 1 peer review.
4. **Integration** → Test locally, then merge into `develop`.
5. **Release** → Only merge `develop` → `main` when stable.

---

### 🌱 Branching Strategy

* **main** → production-ready, stable code
* **develop** → active development branch
* **feature/** → new features (`feature/denampo-borrow-book`)
* **fix/** → bug fixes (`fix/denampo-auth-bug`)
* **chore/** → configs, setup, maintenance

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<lastname>-<short-description>
```

**Examples:**

* `feature/denampo-borrow-book`
* `fix/denampo-auth-bug`

**Rules:**

* Use **lowercase** (except names).
* Keep names short and descriptive.
* Use **hyphens (-)**, not spaces.

---

### 📝 Commit Guidelines

Format:

```bash
<prefix>(<scope>): <message> - <name>
```

**Examples:**

* `feat(borrow): implement book borrowing - Denampo`
* `fix(auth): resolve auth JWT bug - Denampo`
* `docs(readme): update commit guidelines - Denampo`

**Rules:**

* Prefix must follow the table below.
* Use **lowercase** (except names).

| **fix:**      | A bug fix                                        |
| **docs:**     | Documentation only changes                       |
| **style:**    | Code style changes (formatting, no logic change) |
| **refactor:** | Refactoring code (not a fix or feature)          |
| **test:**     | Adding or fixing tests                           |
